________________________
intialize current folder/directory as a git repository:
git init

link local repository to remote repository at Github:
git remote add origin https://github.com/user_name/jhclass.git
where "origin" is a ____ name and the URL is of the Github repository

pull files from remote Github repository to local repository:
git pull https://github.com/user_name/jhclass.git master
where the URL is of the Github repository (same as above) and "master" is the name of the branch

push files from local repository (after adding and committing changes) to remote Github repository:
git push -u origin master
where "origin" refers to the remote repository and "master" refers to the master branch (must modify if pushing to a branch other than the master)
the '-u' attribute sets the branch where the push is happening, so that a subsequent 'pull' command remembers to pull from that branch

________________________
add new files:
git add .

update tracking for deleted files or files that changed names:
git add -u

add new files and update tracking for deleted files and files that changed names:
git add -A


________________________
commit files with message describing changes:
git commit -m "message describing changes"



________________________
view commit history:
git log
git log -p
git log --pretty=oneline


________________________
exclude some files from git tracking:

for project-wide, use .gitignore file

for local, single-user-only , use .git/info/exclude file


https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-syntax-to-ignore-a-entire-folder-in-a-gitignore-file

If a filename or pattern in your .gitignore file happens to match the name of a directory, that directory and all of its contents will be ignored. If all you only want to ignore directories by that name, use

name/

To ignore anything, directory or file, at the top level of your working tree, use

/name



________________________
to delete (remove all record of tracking) files that are now ignored but were previously tracked:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1274057/how-to-make-git-forget-about-a-file-that-was-tracked-but-is-now-in-gitignore



.gitignore will prevent untracked files from being added (without an add -f) to the set of files tracked by git, however git will continue to track any files that are already being tracked.

To stop tracking a file you need to remove it from the index. This can be achieved with this command.

git rm --cached <file>

The removal of the file from the head revision will happen on the next commit.

list tags:
git tag

create annotated tag:
git tag -a v1.0 -m 'version 1.0'

create annotated tag for a previously existing commit (where '9fb44c' are first few characters of the commit hash):
git tag -a v1.0 9fb44c -m 'version 1.0'

show specific commit and tag information by tag name:
git show v1.0

push specific tag to remote repo:
git push origin v1.0

push all tags to remote repo:
git push origin --tags
